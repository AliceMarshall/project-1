####Approach

The 'computers' DictatorShips are randomly placed on its Board from an array of the ships lengths. Ensuring none of the ships are overlaped or off the board vertically or horizontally. Unlike the offical rules to Battleship, ships can be placed directly next to one another, making it easier to win. The same function it run to place the players DictatorShips.
